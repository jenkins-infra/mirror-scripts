⚠️ This repository is archived and its content is managed in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra. See https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/issues/3352 for details.

This repository is a fallback until we fix the Puppet code for this [machine](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/blob/staging/dist/role/manifests/mirrorbrain.pp).

It safer to change those files using PullRequest workflow than manually on the machine
